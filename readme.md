Exercises:
 *Change it so that bands are lazy loaded, then detach and ask them to
  fix it
 *Observe differences between two join tables (one has a full object
  one does not).  What are the consequences of this? (You cannot print
  year joined for the musicians)
 *Write code to select all Songs out of the database
 *Write code to select a particular song out of the database
  then try to get its album (you can't since we have not defined
  the Song->AlbumSong relationship)
  Fix this by adding the appropriate annotations
